# ðŸŽ¯ Complete Gameflow Implementation - Testing Guide

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status
- **Database**: âœ… All migrations deployed to Supabase
- **Frontend**: âœ… Deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Latest URL**: https://6d7a9e18.runaro.pages.dev
- **Production URL**: https://runaro.pages.dev

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issues

### âœ… jennertester League Admin Access
**Problem**: Games tab was not clickable despite having 2+ approved members and being admin.

**Root Cause**: League owner wasn't present in `league_members` table, preventing admin recognition.

**Solution**: Added owner as admin member using correct auth user ID, satisfying foreign key constraints.

### âœ… Games Dialog State Management
**Enhancement**: Improved "Games" button reliability with controlled dialog state.

**Implementation**:
- Added controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` props to GameManagement component
- Centralized dialog content for consistency
- Page-level state management for clean modal lifecycle
- Form state reset on dialog open/close

**Verification**:
```sql
-- jennertester league now has:
-- âœ… Owner has admin membership (role: owner, status: approved)
-- âœ… Total approved members: 2 (meets â‰¥2 requirement)
-- âœ… Foreign key constraints satisfied
```
