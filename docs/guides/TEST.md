# League Game Flow - Implementation Status & Test Results

## Executive Summary

✅ **COMPLETE**: The end-to-end league game flow has been successfully implemented and verified. All core functionality from the original checklist is now operational, with proper database backend, edge functions, and frontend integration.

## Implementation Status

### 1. Database & RPC Layer (Supabase) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Migrations:**
- ✅ Games table has all required columns: `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `winner_user_id`, `duration_days`, `activated_at`
- ✅ Single `create_game(p_league_id uuid, p_name text)` function (no overload conflicts)
- ✅ Essential tables migration (20250914100001) ensures proper structure

**RPC Functions Present & Working:**
- ✅ `create_game` - Validates ≥2 approved members + admin authorization
- ✅ `start_game` - Stores duration, enforces free/pro limits, calls maybe_activate_game
- ✅ `set_player_base` - Sets player's Base then calls maybe_activate_game
- ✅ `maybe_activate_game` - Activates game when everyone has a Base
- ✅ `finish_game` - Marks finished and sets winner
- ✅ `get_game_overview` - Returns meta, base counts, leaderboard
- ✅ `get_player_game_stats` - Returns distance/time totals in eligibility window

**Security & Permissions:**
- ✅ All functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with locked `search_path = public, pg_temp`
- ✅ Proper GRANT/REVOKE: `finish_game` restricted to service_role, others to authenticated
- ✅ RLS policies enforce league membership for game access
- ✅ Guard in `create_game` checks `league_members.status = 'approved'`

### 2. Edge Function / Cron - ✅ COMPLETE

**Function Deployment:**
- ✅ `supabase/functions/finish-due-games/index.ts` deployed and functional
- ✅ Uses `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET` environment variables
- ✅ Supports multiple authentication methods for flexibility

**Cron Configuration:**
- ✅ Database cron job configured to run every 30 minutes
- ✅ Calls finish_game RPC for all active games past end_date
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### 3. Frontend Implementation - ✅ COMPLETE

#### 3.1 GameManagement.tsx - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Duration selector controlled by `useSubscription().isPro`
- ✅ Free accounts: fixed 14 days (corrected from 1-14 range)
- ✅ Pro accounts: 14-30 days selectable
- ✅ Proper game creation flow: `create_game()` → `rpcStartGame()`
- ✅ "Start spillet" button redirects to `/activities?game=<id>&selectBase=1`
- ✅ Strava connection check with fallback to `/strava/connect?return=...`

#### 3.2 LeaguesPage.tsx - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Dialog shows league name and approved member count in header
- ✅ Proper error display for RPC failures
- ✅ "Start spillet" buttons for all users (not admin-only)
- ✅ Removed old manual game start flow
- ✅ Games automatically activate when all bases are set

#### 3.3 ActivitiesPage.tsx - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Detects `?game=<id>&selectBase=1` query parameters
- ✅ Shows banner: "Choose your Base..." with clear instructions
- ✅ "Sæt som Base" button on each eligible activity
- ✅ Calls `setPlayerBase(gameId, activityId)` with proper error handling
- ✅ Success toast confirms base selection

#### 3.4 GamePage.tsx - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Fetches `get_game_overview(gameId)` on load
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions to `games` and `player_bases` tables
- ✅ **Setup State**: Shows "Waiting for bases X/Y"
- ✅ **Active State**:
  - Live countdown timer to end_date
  - KPI cards: time remaining, total distance, time spent
  - Leaderboard sorted by area_km2 with player names
- ✅ **Finished State**: Shows winner name, frozen timer
- ✅ Live updates when new activities arrive

#### 3.5 gamesApi.ts - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ `rpcStartGame` - Calls start_game with duration validation
- ✅ `rpcGetGameOverview` - Returns complete game state
- ✅ `rpcGetPlayerStats` - Player statistics for game period
- ✅ `setPlayerBase` - Base selection functionality
- ✅ `createGame` - Game creation with proper error handling
- ✅ All methods provide informative error messages

#### 3.6 useSubscription.tsx - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Exposes `isPro` status for duration gating
- ✅ Integrates with game creation flow

### 4. Strava Integration Flow - ✅ COMPLETE

**OAuth Flow:**
- ✅ Missing Strava tokens → redirect to `/strava/connect?return=/activities?game=<id>&selectBase=1`
- ✅ After OAuth callback, redirects to return URL for base selection
- ✅ Seamless flow from game start to base selection

### 5. Key Fixes Applied

**Critical Corrections:**
1. **Navigation URLs**: Fixed GameManagement to use `/activities?game=<id>&selectBase=1` instead of `/games/{id}/setup`
2. **Duration Selector**: Corrected free accounts to fixed 14 days (not 1-14 range)
3. **Game Flow**: Replaced admin-manual-start with user-base-selection flow
4. **Dialog Headers**: Added league names and member counts for clarity
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages throughout the flow

## Test Scenarios Verified

### ✅ Pre-game Guards
- **Scenario**: Attempt to create game with <2 approved members
- **Result**: Fails with clear error message from `create_game` RPC
- **Verification**: Database function checks `league_members.status = 'approved'`

### ✅ Free Account Limits
- **Scenario**: Free account selecting duration
- **Result**: Fixed at 14 days, cannot modify
- **Verification**: DurationSelector UI and server-side validation in `start_game`

### ✅ Pro Account Features
- **Scenario**: Pro account creating game
- **Result**: Can select 14-30 days duration
- **Verification**: `useSubscription.isPro` controls UI options

### ✅ Happy Path Flow
1. **Game Creation**: League with ≥2 approved members, admin creates game
2. **Member Participation**: Each member clicks "Start spillet"
3. **Base Selection**: Users navigate to activities page and select base
4. **Auto-Activation**: When last player sets base, game status → 'active'
5. **Game Progression**: Live countdown, stats update with new activities
6. **Completion**: After end_date, edge function marks finished and assigns winner

### ✅ Edge Cases
- **Scenario**: Manual end_date manipulation in database
- **Result**: Edge function correctly identifies and finishes overdue games
- **Verification**: Cron job calls `finish_game` RPC every 30 minutes

## Architecture Validation

### ✅ Security Requirements
- All member counting uses `league_members.status='approved'`
- No function signature conflicts (single create_game implementation)
- User IDs properly resolved via `auth.uid()` → `profiles.id`
- Server validates plan limits (duration restrictions)
- UTC timestamp storage with local display

### ✅ Data Flow
- Database → RPC functions → Frontend API → UI components
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Proper error propagation and user feedback
- Territory calculations via PostGIS integration

## Final Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

The complete league game flow is now functional and ready for end users:

1. **Database Layer**: Fully migrated with all required functions
2. **Backend Services**: Edge functions deployed and scheduled
3. **Frontend Integration**: All components wired with proper flows
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive game creation → base selection → active gameplay
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages throughout
6. **Security**: RLS policies and function permissions properly configured

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete per the original specification. The system supports:
- Multi-player league game creation and management
- Automatic game activation based on player readiness
- Real-time game progression tracking
- Subscription-based feature gating
- Territory-based competitive gameplay

**Recommendation**: Deploy to production and monitor edge function logs for any runtime issues during the first few game cycles.
