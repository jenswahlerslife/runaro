# 🔧 CLOUDFLARE ACCESS ISSUE - WEBSITE LOADING FOREVER

## 🚨 Problem
The website at https://runaro.dk shows "loading forever" because **Cloudflare Access** is enabled on the Pages project, which redirects all visitors to an authentication page.

## ✅ Solution - Disable Cloudflare Access

### Step 1: Open Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your account/workspace
3. Find and click on "Access" in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Disable Access for runaro.pages.dev
1. Look for policies or applications related to:
   - `runaro.pages.dev`
   - `*.runaro.pages.dev`
   - Any wildcard policies affecting Pages

### Step 3: Remove/Disable the Access Policy
1. Find the policy that's protecting the Pages deployment
2. Either:
   - **Delete** the policy entirely, OR
   - **Disable** the policy temporarily

### Step 4: Alternative - Use Zero Trust Settings
1. In Cloudflare Dashboard → "Zero Trust"
2. Go to "Access" → "Applications"
3. Look for applications protecting `runaro.pages.dev`
4. Delete or disable the protection

## 🎯 Current Working URLs
- ✅ **Main site:** https://runaro.dk (works fine)
- ❌ **Pages URLs:** All `*.runaro.pages.dev` URLs are blocked by Access
- ❌ **Latest deployment:** https://00700e33.runaro.pages.dev (blocked)

## 🚀 After Fixing
Once Cloudflare Access is disabled:
1. Website will load normally at https://runaro.dk
2. All Pages deployment URLs will work
3. Users can access the auth page and signup

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ Frontend deployed successfully
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Auth system with name/age fields ready
- ❌ **BLOCKED:** Cloudflare Access preventing public access

## 🛠️ Alternative Solution
If you want to keep Access but allow public access:
1. Create an "Allow" rule for public users
2. Or bypass Access for specific paths like `/auth`

The website itself is working perfectly - it's just the security layer blocking access!
