-- Final Fix for jennertester Admin Access
-- 2025-09-18: Correct approach using auth user ID instead of profile ID

-- The issue is that league_members.user_id should reference auth.users.id, not profiles.id
-- But our leagues.admin_user_id currently references profiles.id
-- So we need to insert using the auth user ID from the profile

-- Insert owner as admin member using the correct auth user ID
WITH jennertester_owner AS (
    SELECT
        l.id as league_id,
        l.admin_user_id as profile_id,
        p.user_id as auth_user_id,  -- This is what league_members.user_id expects
        p.username
    FROM public.leagues l
    JOIN public.profiles p ON l.admin_user_id = p.id
    WHERE l.name = 'jennertester'
    LIMIT 1
)
INSERT INTO public.league_members (league_id, user_id, role, status, joined_at, approved_at, approved_by)
SELECT
    jo.league_id,
    jo.auth_user_id,  -- Use the auth user ID, not profile ID
    'admin',
    'approved',
    NOW(),
    NOW(),
    jo.profile_id  -- approved_by still uses profile ID
FROM jennertester_owner jo
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.league_members lm
    WHERE lm.league_id = jo.league_id
    AND lm.user_id = jo.auth_user_id  -- Check against auth user ID
)
ON CONFLICT (league_id, user_id) DO UPDATE SET
    role = 'admin',
    status = 'approved',
    approved_at = COALESCE(league_members.approved_at, NOW()),
