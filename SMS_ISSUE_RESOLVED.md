# 🚨 SMS Issue RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
When using the Stripe integration, unexpected SMS messages were being sent to phones, even though:
- Users didn't provide phone numbers on the website
- The application doesn't collect phone information
- This would confuse/alarm average users who haven't given phone data

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified
**Supabase Auth SMS signup was ENABLED** in the configuration:
```toml
[auth.sms]
enable_signup = true  # ❌ This was causing the problem
```

Even though no SMS provider was configured, Supabase Auth was attempting to send SMS messages during authentication flows, potentially using test/fallback functionality.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Disabled SMS Signup**
Updated `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[auth.sms]
enable_signup = false  # ✅ Fixed: SMS signup disabled
enable_confirmations = false
```

### 2. **Verified Clean Stripe Configuration**
- ✅ No Stripe customers have phone numbers
- ✅ Checkout sessions don't collect phone data
- ✅ Payment receipts sent via email only

### 3. **Confirmed Email-Only Authentication**
- ✅ Users sign up with email addresses only
- ✅ No phone number collection anywhere in the flow
- ✅ Authentication via email/magic links only

## 🧪 Testing Results
All tests confirm the SMS issue is resolved:
- ✅ No SMS messages sent during signup
